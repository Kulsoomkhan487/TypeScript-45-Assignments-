// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

let val1: number = 100
let val2: number = 60
// this will subtract val1 and val2
console.log(val1 - val2 )


let greeting: string = "hello world,'how are you doing"
// represents a greeting message
console.log(greeting)

let name1: string = "Thomas Edison"
