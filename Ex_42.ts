// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

// Array of magician names
let magiciansNames: string[] = ["David Blaine", "Criss Angel", "Harry Houdini", "Dynamo", "Shin Lim"];
function show_magicians(magicians: string[]): void{
for (const item of magicians){
}
}

function make_great(magicians: string[]): string[]{
  const great_magicians: string[] = magicians.map(magician => `The Great ${magician}`);
  return great_magicians
}
  // the array to add "the great" to each magician's name:
  const great_magiciansNames: string[] = make_great(magiciansNames);

//  the function to show the original magicians names:
console.log("Original Magicians:\n")
show_magicians(magiciansNames);

// the function to show the greatmagicians's names:
console.log("\nGreat Magicians:\n~");
show_magicians(great_magiciansNames);
